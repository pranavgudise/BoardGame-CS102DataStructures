# BoardGame-CS102DataStructures
#In this project you will help determine the probability of winning a board game. Your program will represent the board in a double linked list. Your program will also simulate playing the game with 1,2,3 and finally 4 players.  The program will output the average number of moves necessary for one of the players to “win” the game.
#For more information, see the included document
