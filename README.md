# BoardGame-CS102DataStructures
#In this project you will help determine the probability of winning a board game. Your program will represent the board in a double linked list. Your program will also simulate playing the game with 1,2,3 and finally 4 players.  The program will output the average number of moves necessary for one of the players to “win” the game.![image](https://github.com/pranavgudise/BoardGame-CS102DataStructures/assets/130630160/c6153509-81c4-473e-9027-044ee2eca64a)
